In the realm of love, behold a tale unfolds,
Of a loving Boy and a studious girl, untold.
The Boy, full of affection, does greatly care,
But the girl, consumed by her studies, is unaware.

He, with heart open wide, makes her his prime,
Yet she, consumed by her books, lacks the time.
Though her heart beats for her family's care,
His love, it seems, has remained one-sided, rare.

Three long years have passed with hopes and desires,
Yet her thoughts of romance remain untamed fires.
The Boy yearns to hold her tight, cherish each minute,
But she, lost in her studies, does not permit it.

He accepts her disinterest with a heavy heart,
Deprived of the love he hopes not to depart.
He ceases to correct her, to possess or control,
Choosing instead to grant her wishes, the girl of his soul.

Still, amidst his devotion, unwavering and true,
She treats him as before, no time to pursue.
His gaze lingers solely upon her, no other in sight,
While she, oblivious, continues her scholarly flight.

Oh, the complexities of affection's tangled web,
Where one side yearns while the other remains un-fled.
Yet he persists, faithful and resolute,
His loyalty withholding, his love absolute.

For the Boy, it is her happiness that he seeks,
Even if his love she does not often speak.
In his heart he knows, though it causes dismay,
That their paths may diverge, love's light may fade away.
